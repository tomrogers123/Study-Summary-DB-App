# Core Study Management App

The principal purpose of this project is to create a web app to make it easier to summerise the data that people doing OCR AS Psychology need to know for the exam. I created it because there is an awful lot of data to remember and I found the printed summary sheet provided to me by my college to be cumbersome and overwhelming. Ultimately, the information collected and stored by my solution satisfies all areas of the printed sheet on which it was based.
