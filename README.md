# Core Study Management App

The principal purpose of this project is to create a web app to make it easier to summerise the data that people doing OCR AS Psychology need to know for the exam. I created it because there is an awful lot of data to remember and I found the printed summary sheet provided to me by my college to be cumbersome and overwhelming. Ultimately, the information collected and stored by my solution satisfies all areas of the printed sheet on which it was based.

Even though the primary goal of the project is to create a way to easily manage data about the studies, I hope it will also be useful as a learning tool for those looking to build simple web applications using PHP. To that end, it is going to contain several interesting features:

- The ability to view information stored in a MySQL database.
- A rudimentary permissions system to make sure that only admins are able to add, edit or remove information.
- A complexed form comprising of text fields, radio buttons, choice dropdowns and textareas.
- Semantic use of HTML tables.
- Option to store user data with cookies.
- Custom made jQuery plugin to make large form less intense.
